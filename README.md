# Histomics AWS deployment scripts

This repository contains infrastructure-as-code for reproducible Histomics deployments on AWS
using highly managed, scalable services, including

* Elastic Container Service for the web application
* EC2 instances for celery worker nodes
* DocumentDB as the mongo-compatible database
* Amazon MQ as the celery queue
* CloudWatch for log persistence
* Sentry integration (optional)

### Prerequisites

1. Obtain a domain name via AWS Route53, and set the `domain_name` terraform variable to its value.
1. Create an SSH keypair and set the public key as the `ssh_public_key` terraform variable.
   This is the key that will be authorized on the worker EC2 instance(s).
1. Set AWS credentials in your shell environment.
1. In your target MongoDB Atlas organization, create a new API key and set the public and private
   key in your local environment in the variables `MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY` and
   `MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY`.
1. Set the target MongoDB Atlas organization ID as the `mongodbatlas_org_id` terraform variable.

### Building the worker AMI

1. `cd packer`
1. `packer build worker.pkr.hcl`
1. Use the resulting AMI ID as the `worker_ami_id` terraform variable.

### Deploying

1. `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker build -t zachmullen/histomics-load-test -f histomicsui.Dockerfile .`
1. `docker push zachmullen/histomics-load-test`
1. Copy the SHA from the docker push command and paste it into `main.tf`
1. From the terraform directory, run `terraform apply -var-file=.tfvars`
